# British Airways NLP & ML Prediction

## Overview
This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to analyze and predict customer insights for British Airways. The project is divided into two key areas:
1. **Customer Sentiment Analysis** â€“ Using NLP techniques to extract and classify sentiments from customer reviews.
2. **Customer Buying Behavior Prediction** â€“ Implementing machine learning models to understand key factors influencing booking decisions.

## 1. Customer Sentiment Analysis
### Data Insights
By cleaning **1,000 customer reviews**, the dataset was divided into:
- **Positive Reviews:** 480
- **Negative Reviews:** 413
- **Neutral Reviews:** 107

Additionally, the subjectivity analysis classified:
- **Subjective Reviews:** 537
- **Objective Reviews:** 463

### Preprocessing Steps:
- **Text Cleaning** â€“ Removing punctuation, special characters, and unnecessary elements.
- **Tokenization** â€“ Splitting text into individual words.
- **Stopword Removal** â€“ Filtering out common words that do not add meaning.
- **Stemming/Lemmatization** â€“ Reducing words to their root forms.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization** â€“ Converting text into numerical features for model training.

## 2. Customer Buying Behavior Prediction
### Model Implementation
A predictive model was developed to analyze the **factors influencing customer booking behavior**. The dataset was trained using:
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **XGBoost Classifier**

### Model Performance
The highest achieved scores:
- **Accuracy:** 85.09%
- **AUC Score:** 0.543 (Requires improvement)

### Key Features Impacting Customer Booking Behavior:
- **Booking Origin:** Australia, Malaysia, Taiwan
- **Top Routes:** SBWTPE, BKICN

## 3. Model Performance
Each model was evaluated using key performance metrics:
- **Accuracy** â€“ Measures overall classification performance.
- **Precision & Recall** â€“ Evaluates model sensitivity.
- **F1-Score** â€“ Balances precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix** â€“ Provides insights into false positives and false negatives.

The **deep learning model (LSTM)** demonstrated the highest accuracy for sentiment classification, while Random Forest and XGBoost provided insights into customer booking behavior.
