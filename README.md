# British Airways NLP & ML Prediction

## Overview
This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to analyze and predict insights from British Airways data. Various text-processing techniques and machine learning models were used to extract valuable information and make accurate predictions.

## 1. Data Source & Preprocessing
The dataset includes textual data related to British Airways, such as customer feedback, reviews, and operational reports. The following preprocessing steps were applied:
- **Text Cleaning** â€“ Removing punctuation, special characters, and unwanted text.
- **Tokenization** â€“ Splitting text into individual words.
- **Stopword Removal** â€“ Filtering out common words that do not add meaning.
- **Stemming/Lemmatization** â€“ Reducing words to their root forms.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization** â€“ Converting text into numerical features for model training.

## 2. Model Implementation
Several machine learning models were tested to evaluate their effectiveness in predicting insights from British Airways data:
- **NaÃ¯ve Bayes Classifier**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Deep Learning (LSTM-based model)**

The models were trained using a combination of **TF-IDF features** and **word embeddings** to enhance prediction accuracy.
